# Performance Comparison of Machine Learning Techniques for Classification

## Overview
This project involves the analysis and comparison of different machine learning techniques for classification tasks. The goal is to evaluate the performance of models like Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree in terms of metrics such as Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Accuracy. This analysis helps in understanding which model performs best under specific conditions and datasets.

## Features
- Implementation of Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree classifiers.
- Calculation and comparison of performance metrics: Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Accuracy.
- Visualization of performance metrics using bar charts, line plots, and pie charts.

## Visualizations
The project includes various visualizations to compare the performance of different models:

### 1. Bar Chart: Comparison of Metrics
This bar chart compares the Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Accuracy for each classification technique (Multinomial NB, Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree).
